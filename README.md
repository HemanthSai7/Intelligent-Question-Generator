# Internship-IVIS-labs

-  The *Intelligent Question Generator* app is an easy-to-use interface built in Streamlit which uses [KeyBERT](https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT), [Sense2vec](https://github.com/explosion/sense2vec), [T5](https://huggingface.co/ramsrigouthamg/t5_paraphraser)
-  It uses a minimal keyword extraction technique that leverages multiple NLP embeddings and relies on [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) ðŸ¤— to create keywords/keyphrases that are most similar to a document.
- [sense2vec](https://github.com/explosion/sense2vec) (Trask et. al, 2015) is a nice twist on word2vec that lets you learn more interesting and detailed word vectors.

## Repository Breakdown
### src Directory
---
- `src/Pipeline/QAhaystack.py`: This file contains the code of question answering using [haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/overview/intro).
- `src/Pipeline/QuestGen.py`: This file contains the code of question generation.
- `src/Pipeline/Reader.py`: This file contains the code of reading the document.
- `src/Pipeline/TextSummariztion.py`: This file contains the code of text summarization.
- `src/PreviousVersionCode/context.py`: This file contains the finding the context of the paragraph.

## Installation
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/HemanthSai7/Internship-IVIS-labs.git
```
```shell
$ cd Internship-IVIS-labs
```
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- For the running the app for the first time locally, you need to uncomment the the lines in `src/Pipeline/QuestGen.py` to download the models to the models directory.

```python
streamlit run app.py
```
- Once the app is running, you can access it at http://localhost:8501
```shell
  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://192.168.0.103:8501
